This is the kind of travel that changes you. You can always have a plan, you can always stick to an itinerary, but the beauty of the open road will always slow you down — the scenic route, what a beautiful concept.

With the sprawling San Francisco skyline in your rearview, you’ll head south towards charming Monterey, about two hours, but it’s best if you take your time and embrace little stops along the way. In Monterey, you’ll want to stroll through Fisherman’s Wharf, grab a bite at Cannery Row and of course spend a few hours in the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

From here, you’ll follow the picturesque coastline along the 17-Mile Drive to Pebble Beach, which you may know for its golf course,  but a stop at Fanshell Overlook is a must for spotting harbor seals and Cypress Point Lookout where you’ll find The Lone Cypress, quite possibly the most photographed tree in North America.

Next up is storybook Carmel-by-the-Sea, an artistic town with a stunning beach, cottages on every corner and an area you won’t find a bad meal. A bit quirky: neon signs and honking cars are two things that are not allowed but results in that simple life mentality we all can crave with local shops, easy walking and window shopping and the dreamiest homes.

Further along, you’re greeted with cliffs, crashing waves and plenty of areas to stop off on your way to Big Sur. This is easily one of the most incredible drives of the whole trip. Bixby Bridge is one must-stop with a couple of easy turnoffs to get out and grab your camera. You’ll recognize it from several car commercials and of course if you’re a fan of the HBO drama, Big Little Lies. Not only is the structure beautiful, but the drop off looking out provides you with awe-inspiring rocky sea views.

Lastly, hugging the curves of the highway, you reach Big Sur with majestic cliffs and the Pacific Ocean stretching as far as the eye can see. Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is one stop — prepare to pull over to see the stunning 80-foot McWay Falls. Explore redwoods, coastal overlooks, meadows, bluffs and beaches with an array of hiking options from short hikes of a few miles to more strenuous stretches in the 8-10 mile range.

As a perfect end to the trip, be sure to head to the secluded Pfeiffer Beach for the famed purple sand and a memorable sunset through Keyhole Rock.

Road trips aren’t about the final destination, but the wild discoveries along the way. It’s okay to get a little lost, to get off the direct path. Those moments produce the best memories. Isn’t that the beauty of travel anyway?
